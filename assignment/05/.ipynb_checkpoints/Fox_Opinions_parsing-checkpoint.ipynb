These shootings have seemed a recurring nightmare in our nation. When these events have become so frequent that they are white noise on the news, it is terrifying. It makes me stop and ask, &#x201C;Is this really our nation? Is this reckless chaos really happening in America?&#x201D; It has caused us more pain than sometimes feels bearable. Whether or not you were affected by the deaths of these shootings, they cause us to consider the fragility of life and the suffering so many are currently facing.There is no easy way to explain the purpose of suffering on this earth, especially when the pain from the loss of life runs deeper than most any of us can bear. It wasn&#x2019;t what God initially intended for us. God is the creator and giver of all things good and beautiful, but our world is broken and, as of late, truly horrific.\n",

That violent video games not only train people for murder, but create sociopaths. Therefore, violent video games are a root cause of our prolonged nightmare of large-scale shootings.I have been a video game developer for over two decades and have been a faculty member at the world&#x2019;s leading video game development graduate program, SMU Guildhall in Dallas, for over a decade. I have been on teams that authored best-selling titles and have taught current leaders in the industry at the graduate level.\n",

      "The gunman killed nice people in 30 seconds before officers killed him; Mike Tobin reports.Police in Dayton say they&#x2019;re still seeking a motive for Connor Betts&#x2019; shooting spree that killed nine people, including his sister. But whatever turns up, we hope no one blames Elizabeth Warren.We say that because the news site Heavy.com, which gained access to Betts&#x2019; Twitter account before it was taken down, reports that his politics appear to have been left of center. The shooter recently tweeted that he would &#x201C;happily&#x201D; vote for Senator Warren. His Twitter profile also read: &#x201C;he/him/anime fan/metalhead/leftist/i&#x2019;m going to hell and i&#x2019;m not coming back.&#x201D; In December last he wrote: &#x201C;This is America: Guns on every corner, guns in every house, no freedom but to kill.&#x201D; A month before that, he wrote: &#x201C;Vote blue for gods sake.&#x201D;The Dayton shooter’s leftist ravings are notable only because the media and Democratic politicians have drawn a straight line between the El Paso shooter’s anti-immigrant “manifesto” and Donald Trump and the Republican Party.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n",

      "Daniel Turner, Kent Lassman: Green New Deal is no deal at all – We know because we studied it\n",
      "Power the Future says the progressive policy will cost households at least $70,000 in the first year.When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,&#xA0;and Sen.&#xA0;Ed Markey, D-Mass.,&#xA0;unveiled the Green New Deal in February, they instantly changed the conversation on environmental policy. What in times past would be generally perceived as an intrusive, radically transformative proposal is now the center of Democratic Party&apos;s platform.Power the Future and the Competitive Enterprise Institute have released a joint study showing households in five states can expect tens of thousands of dollars in higher costs for energy, housing, transportation, and shipping if this proposal is implemented.Despite the astronomical costs, many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed the proposal, claiming the radical blueprint to ration energy and transform our economy is exactly what America needs. No longer is it &#x201C;climate change&#x201D; but &#x201C;climate emergency&#x201D; or even &#x201C;climate crisis.&#x201D; As such, small measures are unwelcome to Green New Deal supporters. Only the most radical environmental proposals, paired with a liberal wish list including single-payer health care, a jobs program, and decarbonization of the economy within a decade could possibly be enough.\n",

      "The popular ABC show's star, Hannah Brown, made a remark about her relationship with Jesus in spite of having pre-marital sex. The remark ignited controversy between her and one of the contestants, Luke Parker, who has also been open about being a Christian.ABC&#x2019;s hit reality series &#x201C;The Bachelorette&#x201D; wrapped up last week. Many people, including host Chris Harrison, labeled it the &#x201C;most dramatic season&#x201D; in the show&#x2019;s history.Bachelorette Hannah Brown won the admiration of countless viewers for her strength amidst several controversies both during and after her season on the show.After watching her journey from start to finish, I believe there was one particular moment when she truly shined--and my choice is probably not a popular opinion.\n",

      "The oil tankers, operated by British companies, were seized in international waters.The use of decoys has been used with great success to fool an enemy or deter an enemy from attacking what could be a trap or a trick.Who could forget the most famous decoy in war &#x2013; the Trojan Horse &#x2013; a giant hollow wooden horse used by the Greeks to fool the Trojans. The Horse was left at the gates of Troy as an offering of peace to the goddess Athena the goddess of war. After the horse was left at the gates of Troy, the Greeks retreated. Thereafter, the Trojans moved the horse inside the gates of Troy only to find that the horse was chock full of Greek &#x201C;special forces&#x201D; who exited the horse at dark, opened the gates of Troy and let in the Greek army who overwhelmed the Trojans and captured the city.Fast forward to 1942. The Army built a decoy airfield in Virginia to fool the Nazi Luftwaffe. It was constructed in response to the fear of an attack by ever-increasing long-range bombers. What the phony airfield concealed was batteries of anti-aircraft weapons.\n",

Elijah Cummings and the current state of Baltimore, another feud has been lit.As Republicans readily acknowledge the dangerous culture of Maryland&#x2019;s &#x201C;Charm City,&#x201D; Democrats harp that the city is just fine. Meanwhile, the likes of Bernie Sanders admittedly refer to it as a &#x201C;third world country&#x201D; (though no one would label Sanders a racist for his brutal honesty). It is all just another display of civility dying within our nation.While government, culture and media would say civility should just be thrown out the window, or politeness is what you make it, scripture would say differently. They are the simple lessons we learned as children -- in kindergarten, in Sunday school or in a healthy home -- as to how we approach conflict.\n",
