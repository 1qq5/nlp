0,['Officers on horseback led a black suspect through the streets by rope. The chief apologized.'],"In a pair of photos, two white lawmen atop horses guide a bound black man with a rope down a wide and empty street. If it weren’t for the cars and pavement, a quick glance may lead to the conclusion that they were colorized plates from the antebellum South.    Police lead Donald Neely through Galveston, Tex. (KPRC)  But it was Saturday in the island city Galveston, Tex., and officers arrested Donald Neely on suspicion of criminal trespassing. They had horses, and a rope, but no patrol car to take Neely away. The officers attached the blue rope onto his handcuffs, and Neely, 43, was led to a mounted officer staging area. Bystander photos from the arrest went viral across social media, with many African Americans saying the photos were reminiscent of captured slaves in the 1800s. The outcry prompted an apology on Monday from Galveston Chief Vernon L. Hale III, who called the arrest an “unnecessary embarrassment” for Neely. “I believe our officers showed poor judgment in this instance and could have waited for a transport unit at the location of the arrest,” Hale said in a statement. The officers did not have “malicious intent,” Hale said. The officers trained in the arrest technique for crowd control and other scenarios, Hale said, but the public blowback led the department to rethink how the practice was applied to a sole suspect amid a national discussion about police treatment of African Americans. “We understand the negative perception of this action and believe it is most appropriate to cease the use of this technique,” the department said on Facebook. A cellphone video posted later showed police removing what appeared to be a bag on Neely’s head as he walked. Police told local media it was a welding mask that belongs to him.  Neely was freed on bond, the Associated Press reported. He does not have a listed number and could not be reached to comment. His family’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but told KPRC that she was appalled by the arrest. “I believe the way they handled him was disgusting,” she said. “The family is offended. The family is upset.” Police laughed and joked as he lost consciousness in handcuffs. Minutes later, he died. The department identified the officers only by their first initials and last names, P. Brosch and A. Smith. It is unclear whether they will face an investigation or administrative review. The department did not return a request for comment. Their body-worn cameras were activated during the arrest, the department said. It was unclear what circumstances led to Neely’s arrest, although the department said he had been warned not to trespass several times at 306 22nd St., an office building that includes space for the investment firm Merrill Lynch. It was also unclear why the officers used the rope arrest in the first place. Police said Neely was being led to 21st and Market — about a block away from where he was allegedly trespassing, although police did not say whether that is where they arrested him. "
1,['Opinion | D.C. has gone too far on criminal-justice reform'],"POLICYMAKERS ACROSS the country have assailed mass incarceration, including by enacting measures intended to slash overlong prison sentences. That’s aimed at correcting real problems, including the risk that lengthy incarceration in harsh conditions often impedes rehabilitation. Unfortunately, recent steps by politicians in the District suggest that common sense may be losing out to enthusiasm for reform. Two years ago, the District enacted a measure allowing inmates — specifically those serving lengthy prison terms for major violent crimes committed when they were 16 or 17 — to appeal for sentence reductions, provided they’d already served at least 20 years behind bars. That sensibly left judges with discretion to weigh the original crime’s severity against brain science showing that teenagers are impetuous and ill-equipped to weigh the consequences of their actions. Then the D.C. Council went further. Again acting in the case of juvenile murderers and rapists, it removed a requirement that judges consider a crime’s circumstances when offenders ask for shorter sentences. The legislation, signed by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), also allows convicts to file such requests after serving just 15 years behind bars, not 20, even if they are not yet eligible for parole. Now the council, consisting of 11 Democrats and two independents, is poised to go further still. Under pending legislation, eligibility for sentence reductions would be expanded to include those who committed violent crimes up to age 25. The District’s top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, who opposes the measure, pointed out that its beneficiaries would include a kidnapper who participated in gang-raping a victim inside a stolen van; the murderer of a 7-year-old boy; and a killer who, having stuffed his victim’s corpse in a trash can, proceeded to execute the victim’s girlfriend for fear she could be a witness. By stripping the law of the requirement that judges consider the original crime when weighing sentence reductions — and suggesting long sentences are rarely justified for youthful criminals “despite the brutality or coldblooded nature” of their offense — the council assured that proceedings will tilt in favor of convicts. The reform legislation’s sponsor, council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), contends the court could still consider a crime’s severity if it is weighed against other factors, including evidence of remorse and rehabilitation. However, he wrote to Ms. Liu earlier this year saying that prosecutors would contravene the intent of the law by raising the circumstances of a crime in opposing a sentence reduction. Judges at D.C. Superior Court would be justified in questioning whether they are allowed to consider the circumstances of the original crime when weighing an appeal for a reduced sentence. The District has already gone further in the direction of sentence reductions than virtually any state; if the pending legislation is enacted, allowing sentence reductions for an expanded universe of youthful offenders who committed crimes between ages 18 and 25, that would be unprecedented. The effect would be to allow many of the city’s most violent offenders to seek release from prison in their 30s, regardless of their original sentences. Out the window would go transparency and truth in sentencing — the assurance to victims and the community that punishment is what it appears to be. By discouraging judges from considering the original crime when they weigh reducing sentences, the council is putting the public at increased risk, unnecessarily.  "
2,['Opinion | A smart way to keep Putin out of the next U.S. election'],"THERE IS a lot Congress could do to better protect U.S. elections, and a lot Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not allowed lawmakers to achieve. Now, two senators are offering one more opportunity. Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) are urging colleagues negotiating this year’s defense spending bill to include an amendment in that legislation that they believe would make Russia less likely to repeat its 2016 interference. The provision would mirror parts of the duo’s stand-alone Deter Act, and it also would build on a proposal tacked on to a version of the reauthorization act the House passed last month. The senators’ Deter Act idea differs from its House counterpart in a few ways, the most important of which is that it is more carefully targeted actually to deter. The House bill would impose additional sanctions on Russia’s sovereign debt immediately and make them difficult to remove. Mr.\xa0Van Hollen and Mr. Rubio instead suggest readying sanctions that would take effect in the event of future interference. It’s a smart strategy. Any state that considers taking aggressive action against another weighs the potential costs against the gains. The U.S. response to Russian malfeasance has not been consistent or credible enough to change Vladimir Putin’s calculus. President Trump’s sternest reprimand to the Kremlin leader has been a smirking “ Don’t meddle,” so altering the equation is up to Congress. The House bill would make Russia suffer now, no matter whether it decides to attack again, and the bar for removing sanctions is so high that the country has no guarantee of relief even if it does not. Mr. Van Hollen and Mr. Rubio, on the other hand, would give Russia a clear reason to refrain. The senators’ suggestion has another advantage: Because there is a small stock of sovereign debt available, they would include a panoply of other punishments, including blocking transactions with Russia’s energy, banking and defense sectors, as well as sanctioning oligarchs and other figures participating in any interference efforts. Mr. McConnell can marshal arguments against other essential bills he has blocked, besides the worry that they might offend the president. Rules requiring robust disclosure on online ads, some Republicans say, are campaign finance reform in disguise. Proposals to beef up electoral cybersecurity or back up the process with paper ballots, they claim, constitute federal overreach into a state-led realm. These are substantive, even if not terribly convincing. But there is no excuse for refusing to punish a country that attacks U.S. democracy and every reason to put deterrence in place so it doesn’t come to that.  "
3,['Opinion | President Trump makes it all worse. Here’s how it could be different.'],"WE KNOW by now not to waste time calling on President Trump to do the right thing. He sows division and bigotry rather than promoting unity and understanding. Whatever he promises, in the crunch he capitulates to the gun lobby. But on a weekend of horrifying and hate-fueled violence, we also know that it doesn\t have to be this way. Mass shootings need not be routine, as most every other country demonstrates. Leadership need not be negative and supine. Here is what a presidential president might say: My fellow Americans, These are dark days and nights of August. A weekend — a time for Americans to gather at the beach, the mall, a music festival — has brought us horror. Let us resolve to transform our great anguish into action, permanent and effective action. This horror will no longer be normal in our country. Today, I am calling on Congress to return to Washington for an immediate joint session, to give up their district politicking and take action to combat gun violence. Enact a ban on sales of military-style assault rifles, as well as high-capacity magazines. This weaponry was made for war; its purpose is to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible. It doesn’t belong on our streets. Make background checks mandatory. And for those who have other ideas, such as federal licensing and buy-backs, come forward, and we will work on them. I have instructed my administration to undertake a major scientific research effort on gun violence that will help us chart more answers in the long term. We must free ourselves of a special interest lobby. I will personally campaign for the solutions as hard as I can and invite those from both parties to join me. E.J. Dionne Jr.: On guns and white nationalism, one side is right and one side is wrong I am also sick about the rivers of hate speech and fear coursing through our society. It is time to assert, in the boldest way we can: In America, there is no room for racism, no tolerance for hatred, no silence in the face of those who incite racial violence and preach manifestos of supremacy. We welcome and value all Americans, no matter where they or their ancestors came from. As difficult as it will be, we must confront this dark sickness on the digital pathways, on the cultural playgrounds and in the classrooms. This is not only a job for government. It is a mission for all of us, but I am asking law enforcement to boost its attention to combating domestic terrorism. We can bring change while respecting our fundamental values. We will not trample on free speech, free assembly or the constitutional right to bear arms. But rights have always come with responsibilities, and I think it is time we seize that responsibility and act as though our rights depended upon it. Let us give our word to the victims — to the dozens killed and wounded this weekend, and the hundreds and thousands in recent years — that we will not rest without results. Thank you, and let’s get to work.  "
4,['Opinion | A Chinese dissident jailed for critical thought deserves the world’s help'],"HUANG QI, one of China’s most prominent human rights activists who has already spent nearly half of the past two decades in prison and state detention, was sentenced Monday to 12 years in prison. His supposed crime was leaking state secrets, but in actuality his only offense was speaking out against government wrongdoing. The harsh punishment — which could amount to a death sentence, given his frail health — is the latest sign of the extreme lengths that President Xi Jinping’s Communist Party will go to silence political dissent. In 1998, the veteran “cyber-dissident” set up 64\xa0Tianwang, a website initially designed to investigate and report on Chinese citizens who had disappeared. Named for the violent June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, Mr. Huang’s website continues to use a nationwide network of volunteers to document the increasingly dire human rights situation in China, albeit it is blocked on the mainland. His tireless efforts landed him five years in prison in 2000 for “state subversion” and three years in 2009 for investigating the deadly collapse of poorly constructed schools during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In addition to the prison sentence, Mr. Huang was deprived of political rights for four years and fined 20,000 yuan, approximately $3,000. After three years of pretrial detention, Mr. Huang’s medical condition continues to deteriorate, with reports of kidney and heart diseases, possible emphysema and inflammation in the lungs. He has, so far, been denied proper medical treatment. The government’s harassment and abuse of Mr.\xa0Huang extend beyond him. His mother, Pu\xa0Wenqing, was detained incommunicado for several weeks in 2018 after appealing for her son’s urgent medical release. The 86-year-old has been under guarded house arrest since February. Additionally, two of Mr. Huang’s lawyers were disbarred for representing him in court — further isolating the ailing man. Unfortunately, Mr. Xi’s broad campaign to silence critical thought shows no sign of slowing down. Mr.\xa0Huang is just one of countless individuals who have been abused because of their dedication to human rights and refusal to buckle to the propaganda of the Chinese regime. Among those who have died in state custody or soon after their release: 2010 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, Cao Shunli, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and, in July this year, Ji Sizun. More than a dozen international human rights groups, including the United Nations, have pushed for Mr. Huang’s immediate release. Instead of arbitrarily imprisoning Mr. Huang for baseless crimes for which he has suffered enough, China should heed the calls for clemency.  "
5,['Opinion | Trump’s family separations suggest that humane and decent conduct is optional'],"MEMO TO U.S. Customs and Border Protection: Migrant children are not chattel. They are not contraband. They are not instruments of deterrence. They are children, and they are fragile, and some Border Patrol agents, albeit a relatively small number, seem hard-pressed to absorb and be guided by that basic human information. The fact that the Trump administration continues to break apart families even when the pretext for doing so is slight — a minor crime on a parent’s record; a soiled diaper used as “proof” of neglect; an unsubstantiated hunch that an adult is not actually a child’s parent — suggests that basic principles of humane and decent conduct remain optional. Even after a federal judge ordered the government to reunify families in June 2018, following the administration’s disastrously cruel policy that outraged the nation, the practice of wrenching children away from their parents did not stop; it merely slowed. The Trump administration ended the “zero tolerance” policy that resulted in systematic family separations 13 months ago but, since then, 911 children have been separated from their parents, according to a court filing by the American Civil Liberties Union. According to government records, 678 of those separations were for alleged criminal offenses involving the parents. But in the information it provided the court, the government made little distinction between crimes that were proved or alleged, serious or minor, recent or long ago. And in many cases detailed by the ACLU, the reasons for taking a child from their parents were flimsy at best: a father whose speech impediment kept him from answering a Border Patrol agent’s questions; convictions for marijuana possession; driving without a license. No one doubts there are good reasons to scrutinize migrant families seeking asylum and subject them to questioning, and legitimate circumstances that justify separating children from families — when parents are serious criminals, or pose a threat to their children, or are incapable of providing competent care. In rare instances, migrant adults who pose as parents are unrelated to the children in their care and are using them in an attempt to cross the border and claim asylum; in those cases, the government must intervene. The problem is that the administration continues separating some children from their actual, competent parents — caregivers who pose no threat to their offspring. Which raises a question: How could anyone imagine that a child is better off under the protection of government agencies than in the care of their parents? The ongoing practice of shattering families is evidence of the administration’s callous indifference — to migrant children, including toddlers and many others under the age of 10, who are at risk of lasting emotional and psychological scars; and to migrant parents, whose suffering is unimaginable. The ACLU has asked U.S. District Judge Dana M.\xa0Sabraw to set specific rules under which family separation can be undertaken by the authorities. Given the fast, loose and flexible standards that some agents have employed, the judge’s intervention is a matter of urgency.  "
6,['An 11-year-old’s response to El Paso shooting: One act of kindness for each victim'],"In the shadow of shock that lingered after the weekend mass shooting in El Paso, one crestfallen sixth-grader had an idea to help his community cope. Ruben Martinez named it the “#ElPasoChallenge” and described it — by hand in a notebook — as a way “to honor the people who got killed in our city.” The 11-year-old challenged “each person in El Paso to do 20 good deeds for each other,” an act of kindness to commemorate the lives lost during the massacre. For example, he suggested, mow a neighbor’s lawn or visit a nursing home, comfort someone sad or stressed, leave a dollar inside a vending machine to surprise the next person, or write a letter telling the recipient he or she is great. At the time, authorities said 20 people were killed in the shooting, but two more victims have since died.    My son has been having some bad anxiety after yesterday’s event. After some discussion, he came to me asking if I would...Posted by Rose Gandarilla on&nbsp;Sunday, August 4, 2019   Rose Gandarilla, the boy’s mother, said Martinez has been overwrought since Saturday’s shooting. “I explained to him that we could not live in fear and that people in our community are caring and loving,” she explained to CNN. Thus was conceived the El Paso Challenge. The goal was to encourage kindness “all day, every day,” Gandarilla said. Martinez also had a strategy to spread the word and persuade others to accept the challenge. He passed out fliers, hung posters and promoted it on social media. His mother posted the challenge on Facebook and Twitter, where it has been shared and liked thousands of times. “This will show the world that people from El Paso are kind and care for each other,” Martinez added at the bottom of his notebook page.

7,['Opinion | Trump’s policies are bringing instability to a fragile world economy'],"WE’LL FIND out the consequences of President Trump’s sudden threat of a 10\xa0percent tariff on $300 billion in consumer goods from China soon enough. Either he intends it to go into effect 30 days from now, on Sept. 1, as his statement Thursday implied. Or he may yet cancel the tariffs in response to some concession, actual or perceived, from China between now and then. He has tried the latter tack in the past, and the president’s reasons for making his latest threat — China’s alleged failure to buy promised U.S. agricultural goods, and to stop illegal fentanyl exports — hint at what China could give Mr. Trump when trade talks resume in Washington next month. What is already clear is that the United States, China and the world face a few weeks of uncertainty surrounding the world’s largest bilateral trading relationship. This, added to the uncertainty already clouding the world’s second-largest such relationship — the one between the United States and Canada, which awaits ratification of a renegotiated free-trade deal — confirms that Mr. Trump’s policies are becoming one of the greatest sources of instability for a fragile world economy. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H.\xa0Powell cited “trade tensions,” albeit without blaming the president, as a key rationale for making a small interest rate cut with the prospect of more this year. Though expected, the step was nevertheless unusual given that the central bank rarely prescribes easier money for an economy at full employment. Yet Mr.\xa0Powell felt that a recent slowing in business investment and manufacturing activity in the United States and abroad called for a dose of financial support, and that it was safe to administer it given persistently low inflation. Also on his mind was the need to compensate for the Fed’s having raised rates a bit too quickly in 2018. We don’t second-guess interest rates. What’s worrisome, though, is that, by his own admission, Mr. Powell lacks quantitative tools to measure the impact of trade tensions and must therefore rely on intangibles in responding to them. It has been decades since the Fed had to contend with an openly and aggressively protectionist U.S. administration, so Mr. Powell is “learning by doing,” as he put it. The Fed is also coping with an unprecedentedly public demand for looser monetary policy from the White House, which continued Wednesday when Mr.\xa0Trump complained, on Twitter, that the rate cut was insufficient and that he is “certainly not getting much help from the Federal Reserve!” Mr. Trump’s gripe is the opposite of the truth — in two ways. First, if the Fed’s rate cut does limit the harm to U.S. growth from tariff wars, it will enable Mr. Trump to wage them. And second, it is Mr.\xa0Powell who is being undermined by Mr. Trump. His credibility, and his effectiveness, depends on the perception of political independence. Yet when Fed rate cuts follow Trump tweets demanding them, Mr.\xa0Powell cannot help but appear politically subservient, even if — as is surely the case — he acted in good faith. Mr. Trump should stop badgering the Fed before he does real harm to the perceived integrity of the world’s most important monetary policymaker.  "
8,['Opinion | Saudi Arabia loosens its male guardianship system — but not nearly enough'],"SAUDI ARABIA’S latest steps to ease the onerous male guardianship system and give women more control over their own lives can only be applauded and encouraged. The kingdom has published decrees allowing women to apply for passports on an equal basis with men, register the births of their children and gain new protections against employment discrimination. But these steps inevitably also call attention to what is not being done to ease the kingdom’s draconian practices. The kingdom’s male guardianship system forces women to get permission from men for a wide range of activity, consigning women to second-class status. The new decree lifts one part of that, obtaining a passport, which women will be able to do on their own. The Saudi ambassador to Washington, Princess Reema bint Bandar, said on Twitter that Saudi women will be allowed to travel abroad independently without male guardian permission, which is just as important as obtaining a passport, and would be a welcome step forward. Likewise, the new measures specifically ban all employment discrimination, which could mean that employers cannot continue to demand that women get permission from fathers or husbands to work, and may also protect women against threats of being fired for pregnancy. But if these measures can be taken now by the de facto Saudi leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, why not completely free women from the shackles of the guardianship system? Why must women get male permission to marry, exit prison or get higher education? What possible justification is there for doling out just a few changes now? The Saudi kingdom is a dictatorship, and the prince dispenses change at his pleasure. The latest decision must be bittersweet for the imprisoned women, including Loujain al-Hathloul, who were taken from their homes in the middle of the night May 15, 2018, for having the temerity to advocate for more rights for women, including the right to drive. If Saudi Arabia is really serious about helping women reach their “full potential,” as the kingdom claims, then it will release Ms. Hathloul and the others, as well as men who are imprisoned in order to silence them, including the dissident blogger Raif Badawi. The crown prince would dearly like to change the conversation back to his “Vision 2030” reform plan to attract foreign investment. But the recent dark passages in Saudi behavior under his rule will not simply disappear — including the murder and dismemberment of our colleague Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit squad, the continued repression of freedom of expression and dissent, and the misguided war in Yemen. Human rights are not palace trinkets to be dispensed by the crown prince when he needs better public relations. They are universal values that belong to every person. They are still widely abused in Saudi Arabia, a kingdom that has a long way to go toward respect for human dignity.  "
9,['Opinion | The Trump administration’s new policy again shows its contempt for Central Americans'],"HERE’S WHAT the State Department recommends for U.S. travelers to Guatemala: Do not walk or drive at night. Request security escorts. In the capital, Guatemala City, do not hail taxis on the streets and avoid 10 specific neighborhoods, including one around the airport. Here’s what the Trump administration recommends to non-U.S. travelers to Guatemala, namely those from other Central American countries: Stay there and apply for asylum. Don’t even think about continuing north to the U.S. border. The juxtaposition is absurd but no less so than the agreement the administration struck last week with Guatemala — that it be considered a “safe third country” to which the United States will return asylum seekers if they have not already sought refuge there. If the administration’s contempt for Central Americans fleeing violence, hardship and persecution was not already clear, this new policy clarified it. The rule, set to take effect in the coming weeks if U.S.\xa0or Guatemalan courts don’t block it, is mainly aimed at migrants from El Salvador and Honduras. They constitute the second- and third-largest cohorts of asylum seekers crossing the U.S. southwestern border in recent months, and most of them traverse Guatemala on their trek northward. (The largest cohort is Guatemalans themselves, who accounted for a majority of the more than 100,000 migrants stopped at the border monthly this past spring.) President Trump, irate at the migrant flow, has used slander — “these are bad people,” he told reporters — and a grab bag of legally dubious deterrent measures. He is right that Customs and Border Protection and other agencies are struggling to handle the tide, which resulted in nearly 700,000 apprehensions in the current fiscal year through June, compared with scarcely 400,000 the entire previous year. But it is morally indefensible to attack a migration problem by putting migrants themselves at risk. That is precisely what the administration’s new move would do. The United States maintains a safe-third-country agreement with Canada, meaning that asylum seekers can be returned to that country to apply for refuge if they crossed the border from there. That makes sense because Canada is generally safe; Guatemala is anything but. And the retort of acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan, who noted that parts of the United States are also unsafe, is risible. Guatemala’s crime rate dwarfs that of the United States; the homicide rate there is five times higher. The probable result of the administration’s policy, if it goes into effect, will be to transform legal asylum seekers into undocumented immigrants. They are unlikely to seek refuge in Guatemala, which has no administrative mechanism to process thousands of asylum applications — and which agreed to the deal with the United States only after Mr. Trump threatened severe sanctions. Instead, many will likely cross illegally into the United States and live in the shadows. Mr. Trump’s response is to build his border wall, which got a lift last week when the Supreme Court said construction could proceed while challenges to funding it continue in the courts. But walls can be scaled, tunneled under and circumnavigated; Mr.\xa0Trump’s wall would not stanch the flow of migrants nor improve the conditions that drive them from their countries.  "
10,['Opinion | A bipartisan retreat on trade'],"THE UNITED STATES, which on a bipartisan basis led the world into a post-World War II era of increasingly free trade and, over time, widely shared prosperity, is now poised to retreat from trade — also on a bipartisan basis. This is the distressing implication of the new trade policy proposal unveiled by a leading Democratic contender for president, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). As the Trump administration scraps trade agreements and picks tariff fights around the world, Ms.\xa0Warren offers ideas that differ, somewhat, in language from President Trump’s but resemble them closely in protectionist spirit. “We will engage in international trade — but on our terms and only when it benefits American families,” her plan says. All that’s missing are the actual words “America First.” The main difference between Ms. Warren and Mr. Trump is that the president primarily vilifies the United States’s trading partners — everyone from China, which really does play unfairly, to Canada, an ally with which this country has relatively balanced trade — while Ms. Warren blames “big multinational corporations” for their lack of “loyalty or allegiance to America.” Business has profited from U.S.\xa0trade policy, she claims, while “everyone else has paid the price.” Everyone? Even farmers and workers in export industries? Even U.S. consumers who benefit from less expensive goods? The truth about trade is that it creates losers in the U.S.\xa0economy but also winners. Like Mr. Trump, Ms. Warren accentuates only the negative. She does so in support of a program that would make all U.S. trade negotiation positions public as talks proceed, to end secret corporate influence, without explaining why any other country would agree to conduct talks in front of the cameras. She says the United States will make other countries’ adherence to high standards of human rights, environmental and labor protection, such as the elimination of all “domestic fossil fuel subsidies,” a precondition of trade talks. As Ms. Warren acknowledges, the United States itself could not meet her preconditions, though she is “committed to fixing that as President.” On the core of Mr. Trump’s policy — tariffs — Ms.\xa0Warren waffles, calling them “an important tool” that must be “part of a broader strategy.” She’s for a tax on imported goods to offset carbon-intensive production abroad, which functions very much like a tariff, absent an equivalent carbon tax on U.S.-made goods. Ms. Warren’s main beef with recent trade deals is that they protect longer intellectual property rights for drug companies, though even this is not a simple matter, because too little protection could discourage needed innovation. Still, the good news, such as it is, about her plan is that, while it would make new trade agreements nearly impossible, it would not necessarily unravel existing ones. At the Detroit Democratic debate Tuesday night, former Maryland congressman John Delaney and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper gamely pointed out the fact that Ms. Warren was abandoning the party’s more balanced traditions, as practiced most recently under President Barack Obama. Pushback from Democrats such as these is now all that’s standing between the world and a risky new trade-unfriendly political consensus in the United States.               "
11,['Opinion | Kamala Harris’s health-care plan shows there are ambitious options outside of Medicare-for-all'],"LAST WEEK’S Democratic presidential debates underscored health care as a defining policy division among the candidates. On one side, many of those who argue for radical change would tell you, are Democrats who want to preserve a status quo in which private companies suck profits out of sick and vulnerable people. Their alternative is killing off the insurance companies and providing universal, high-quality, government-controlled care. The description is simplistic. The Democratic field is unanimous in its desire to provide universal coverage; the candidates just disagree on how to get there. And, though the Medicare-for-all plan of Sens.\xa0Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has become almost synonymous with “single-payer,” European-style health care, it is not the only way to achieve even that goal — just a disruptive, expensive way. Enter Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a backer of the Medicare-for-all concept who nevertheless released her own take on what that should mean shortly before last week’s debate. Rather than force all Americans onto the same government-run plan, she would create a universal version of a system that resembles the actual, existing Medicare program. In essence, Ms. Harris would turn insurance companies into public utilities and allow them to compete with a government-run service. Seniors on Medicare are able to choose between the government-run option or plans administered by highly regulated private companies. This gives people choices in benefit design and plan administration. Strict regulations mean that profits are not extortionate and that needed care is not denied. Regardless of who runs each plan, the government is ultimately responsible for paying the tab. Ms.\xa0Harris’s plan would offer this deal to everyone, regardless of age. Experience with the current Medicare program, in which about one-third  of seniors are enrolled in regulated private plans, as well as in countries that have created similar systems, suggests that people avail themselves of various options when they are given choices. This feature makes these systems no less universal, just less coercive. Of course, Ms. Harris must answer the same questions that others must. She claims she can provide universal, highly subsidized government-run care without raising taxes on the middle class. To do so, she relies on the math that Mr. Sanders and Ms.\xa0Warren have used to make their plan look affordable. But independent analysis indicates that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren would raise far too little money to finance their ambitious health-care expansion, which would include dental and vision benefits and no cost-sharing. Unlike Mr. Sanders and Ms.\xa0Warren, Ms. Harris might require people to pay premiums, depending on income, which could make her plan fiscally saner. But, on this point, her proposal is not clear. Ms. Harris appears to be making a massive bet that her long phase-in period — 10 years — would enable the government to finally figure out how to drive down health-care costs, resulting in affordable coverage and benefit expansion when it is fully phased-in. Yet history suggests little cause for optimism on this score. Ms. Harris’s contribution is welcome. It shows there are ambitious alternatives to so-called Sanders\xadcare that progressives should be able to consider equally, if not more, serious about achieving universal coverage. But Ms. Harris will have to do more explaining before voters can decide whether the numbers behind it are ultimately more plausible than those underpinning the unrealistic Sanders-Warren plan.  "
12,['Opinion | Trump should vow never again to spew his loathing from the bully pulpit'],"PRESIDENT TRUMP controls the greatest loudspeaker in the world. On Monday, he said from the White House that “our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy.” He added, “Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul.” Well put. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has recklessly used racism, bigotry and hatred for many years, in coded formulas and direct speech. To truly honor the victims of El Paso and Dayton, Mr. Trump should vow never again to spew his loathing from the bully pulpit. Mr. Trump has stigmatized Mexicans since the day he announced his candidacy for president, and has spoken as though all Muslims are dangerous. He denounced Latino migration as “an invasion of our country,” demonizing undocumented immigrants as “thugs” and “animals.” At a rally in May in Panama City Beach, Fla., he asked, “How do you stop these people? You can’t.” Someone in the crowd yelled back one idea: “Shoot them.” The audience of thousands cheered — Trump smiled. Shrugging off the suggestion, he quipped, “Only in the Panhandle can you get away with that statement.” When avowed white supremacists marched in Charlottesville in August 2017 and one of them drove his car into a crowd, killing a peaceful protester, Heather Heyer, Mr.\xa0Trump condemned “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,” as though others besides the white supremacists were to blame. Helaine Olen: Trump’s speech was like a hostage video Mr. Trump wrote in January on Twitter, “More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted invasion of illegals through large Caravans into our country.” Mr. Trump also wrote last November that “the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it.” Before opening fire in El Paso and killing 22 innocent people, the 21-year-old alleged shooter wrote, “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.” Mr.\xa0Trump said in July, “Allowing the immigration to take place in Europe is a shame. I think it changed the fabric of Europe and, unless you act very quickly, it’s never going to be what it was, and I don’t mean that in a positive way.” The shooter wrote, “The natives didn’t take the invasion of Europeans seriously, and now what’s left is just a shadow of what was.” The president’s words have wide and deep consequences. When he smears all Latinos or Muslims, announcing walls or visa bans to keep them out; when he denounces the news media as “enemies of the people,” using Stalinist terms; when he says four congresswomen of color should “go back” to the countries they came from — all these spread fear, exclusion and hatred. The president cannot be held responsible for every irresponsible act of citizens. But he can he held to account for propagating ugly and bigoted notions in his public remarks. This would be a good moment to change direction.  "
13,['Opinion | Beware the rabbit hole of radicalization'],"THE INTERNET is not responsible for America’s mass shooting epidemic. The single most salient factor is easy access to guns designed for mass killing. But poisonous ideologies such as white supremacy are increasingly incubated online before bursting into the world wielding an assault rifle, and radicalization is easier than ever when propagandists can broadcast their beliefs in an instant to millions, who will broadcast them to millions more. “The perils of the Internet and social media cannot be ignored, and they will not be ignored,” President Trump said on Monday. It is ironic to hear Mr. Trump demonize platforms for promoting radicalization even as his administration accuses those very same platforms of censorship in response to their efforts to reduce radicalization. But the peril is real, and the question is what paying attention actually looks like. The massacre in El Paso this past weekend began with a racist manifesto, as did the massacres at the Chabad of Poway synagogue and in Christchurch , New Zealand. All of these appeared, minutes before the shooting, on 8chan — a messaging board that operates on lawlessness. Posters celebrated this weekend’s alleged perpetrator in El Paso as “our guy”; the goal is to beat the last guy’s body count, referred to in a ghoulish gamification of large-scale violence as a “high score.” There are ways to drive 8chan into deeper recesses of the Web if not off the Web entirely, starting with the services that provide the site technical support turning it away. Two such services have done so this week, forcing 8chan at least temporarily offline. There is a worry that hiding 8chan and similar forums from sight could make threats more difficult to spot, but that risk is outweighed by the advantage of making it more difficult for everyone to spot 8chan. Radicalization is a problem of falling into a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole should be as difficult as possible to stumble into. Even then, erasing the ecosystem of right-wing terrorism is a monumental task. Larger, more responsible platforms can do their part, stepping up their own efforts against white-supremacist content, adjusting their algorithms so that they do not promote posts that push people toward even more extreme parts of the Web, or blockading content that originates in forums infamous for incitement. But their ability to act has limits, as does the scope for government’s action. Authorities should dedicate more resources to stopping the next shooter before he has a chance to shoot, yet every effort will involve trudging through a morass of memes and irony designed to disguise threats as jokes and jokes as threats. The greatest power of this machine of racism and mass murder is its inscrutability. Getting rid of 8chan would not get rid of right-wing terrorism on the Internet, and getting rid of right-wing terror on the Internet would not get rid of right-wing terrorism in the country. But there are steps we can take today, and there’s a commitment we can make for tomorrow: to confront this ugly racism everywhere it lives.  "
14,['Opinion | Getting access to Trump’s tax returns is important. So is fighting for them within the bounds of the Constitution.'],"ESTABLISHED IN the mid-1970s, as a response to a controversy involving tax deductions taken by President Richard M. Nixon, the U.S. tradition of the voluntary release of tax return information by presidential candidates remained strong until 2016, when President Trump violated it. Really, he shredded it. Mr. Trump not only refused to release his returns, he did so despite his own previous claims that he would disclose them and gave only a phony rationalization that he was under Internal Revenue Service audit. As president, Mr. Trump has continued the stonewalling, adding the new excuse that his victory in the 2016 election proves voters either do not care about his non-disclosure, or approve of it. Mr. Trump’s duplicity is not only outrageous per se but also creates an inference that he has something to hide. The challenge for those who justifiably seek to prevent Mr. Trump from getting away with this is how to respond, without responding in kind. His violation of norms cannot be the basis for a counter-violation resulting in a political race to the bottom. Which brings us to the new California law, just signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), that would deny a spot on the state’s March 2020 primary election ballot to any candidate who fails by late November 2019 to submit five years’ worth of tax returns for public disclosure. In signing the bill, Mr. Newsom said we are living in “extraordinary times” that require the states “to do everything in their power to ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards, and to restore public confidence.” We share the governor’s belief in transparency but not his confidence that the new law is constitutional, given the Supreme Court’s 1995 ruling — in the admittedly different context of congressional term limits — barring the states from imposing new qualifications for federal office. That precedent at least implies it would be unconstitutional to make ballot eligibility contingent on submitting a tax return, as long as a presidential candidate is a 35-year-old natural-born citizen. The case would be different, and more clearly constitutional, if failure to disclose were punishable by a fine, as campaign finance violations are, but that is not how the new California law reads. The law also would be less objectionable, though in our view still constitutionally suspect, if California’s statute took effect in 2024, rather than now, when it is so clearly aimed at one person. As it is, California invites a partisan tit-for-tat. Another state might demand health records, high school report cards, college transcripts or birth certificates — depending on what might be most politically advantageous. Mr. Newsom’s Democratic predecessor, Jerry Brown, cited precisely those concerns in vetoing a previous version of the bill in 2017. Getting public access to Mr. Trump’s returns is important; so, too, is fighting for that disclosure within the bounds of constitutionality and sound judgment.  "
15,['Opinion | A strong reform bill might help restore some faith in the U.S. Olympic officials'],"SENATE INVESTIGATORS released a chilling report last week on the failure of seemingly everyone who had responsibility to stop the sexual abuse of Olympic gymnasts by disgraced former team doctor Larry Nassar — and the buck-passing that occurred after the Indianapolis Star revealed Dr. Nassar’s horrors. Along with the report came the release of a bipartisan bill aiming to prevent such abdication in the future. It should pass — and quickly. “Repeatedly, institutions failed to act aggressively to report wrongdoing to proper law enforcement agencies,” the report found, and even when law enforcement heard allegations, “the FBI’s investigation dragged on and was shuffled between field offices while Nassar continued to see patients.” Senate investigators concluded that USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee “knowingly concealed abuse by Nassar, leading to the abuse of dozens of additional amateur athletes during the period beginning the summer of 2015 and ending in September 2016.” And the report revealed that the problem does not seem to be limited to gymnastics. “Even as Nassar’s case captured the headlines, it was hardly the only case of unchecked criminal behavior in amateur Olympic sports,” the report found. “His case underscored serious allegations of sexual abuse made in USA Taekwondo, USA Swimming, U.S. Figure Skating, and other sports.” The system requires reform. A bill from Sens.\xa0Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) would provide it. The legislation would explicitly charge the Olympic committee with responsibility for athlete safety, including through oversight of sports federations such as USA Gymnastics. No longer could the committee claim it lacked authority over sports federations to do little as credible claims of abuse are reported — or to escape blame for tragedies like the Nassar episode. Neither the committee nor a sports federation could legally decline to report allegations of child sexual abuse to law enforcement. More athletes would be added to their governing bodies, and an organization policing abuse in amateur sports would be beefed up. Olympic committee chief executive Sarah Hirshland praised the bill last week, though she also warned of “unintended consequences and disruption for athletes in operational reality” that she did not specify. Lawmakers should hear the Olympic committee’s concerns but not be diverted from the central job of better protecting young athletes. The Olympic committee and everyone else who failed in the Nassar catastrophe now suffer from a deep deficit of trust. A strong reform bill might help restore some faith in these organizations — and in the spirit of clean competition that amateur athletics is supposed to promote.  "
16,"['When the Dayton shooter killed his sister, he cut short a life full of promise, friends say']","Megan K. Betts had more to offer. When Connor Betts opened fire in a crowded Dayton, Ohio, nightlife district over the weekend, killing his 22-year-old sister along with eight other people, he cut short a life full of promise and warmth, according to friends, colleagues and teachers. Megan Betts was a stellar student, popular with peers and beloved by most everyone who spent time with her, whether in school band practice sessions or touring the wilds of Montana. This fall, she would have entered her senior year at Wright State University in Dayton, where she majored in earth and environmental sciences and sang in the school chorus. “Megan was always a standout; she was extremely bright,” said Elizabeth Greenawalt, 63, whose three children attended Bellbrook High School about the same time as Betts did. The lives lost in Dayton People from different parts of her life said Betts was defined by a fervent desire to help others. Her selflessness left a mark: Those who lost touch with Betts years ago grew teary recounting their memories of her. High school friend Cayla Destefani, 22, said Betts “literally shone.”  “She just had the brightest blue eyes and the brightest smile; she was the kind of girl who could just light up the room,” Destefani said. “I was really blessed to know her.”  “I don’t think she had a mean bone in her body,” said Addison Brickler, 23, who rode the school bus with Betts for years. Destefani’s stories date back to early childhood. She and Betts attended Stephen Bell Elementary School in Bellbrook, Ohio, traveled to Girl Scout camp together and spent hours playing with “little fairy dolls” in Betts’s room, Destefani said. Betts, who often wore bright colors as a child, adored fairies and unicorns, according to Destefani. She also loved walking through the woods and learning about the environment with her Girl Scout troop, a hobby that may have led to her choice of major at Wright State, Destefani said. Betts’s passion for science became clear in high school, said Zoe DeAtley, 20, who was close with Betts at the time. Betts particularly enjoyed that subject, as well as mathematics, and was talented in both fields, DeAtley said. “I was really bad at math and science, but she would sit there and help me,” DeAtley said through tears. “She always offered help with schoolwork if someone needed it.”  Ex-girlfriend says Dayton shooter heard voices, talked about ‘dark, evil things’ Outside the classroom, Betts acted in theatrical productions and joined the Bellbrook band, where she earned a reputation as everyone’s “big sister,” DeAtley said. DeAtley performed alongside Betts, who played the trumpet. Betts was legendary among band members for her willingness to help anyone with absolutely anything — it “didn’t matter if you were a freshman or a senior,” DeAtley said. Many people knew to go to Betts if they were in trouble or feeling down. “She never let anyone feel left out,” DeAtley said. In her free time, Betts listened to bands such as Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco, DeAtley said. When she reached college, she kept up her love of music by joining the Wright State choir.    Megan Betts, second from left, and her friends prepare for senior prom at Bellbrook High School in 2015.  Steven Aldredge, a longtime pianist for the Wright State chorus, said it can be hard to keep track of the scores of students he has played with over the years. But when he saw Megan Betts’s face in the news, he “immediately realized who she was”: That “sunny, upbeat” demeanor was unmistakable, he said. James Tipps, a professor of music at Wright State and the chorus’s conductor, said Betts had “a good, strong voice” and a preference for the lowest alto parts. Her favorite works of music included Felix Mendelssohn’s “Elijah” and Gabriel Fauré’s “Requiem.”  She was a perfectionist who wanted things to be done well and was unafraid to speak up if performances failed to meet her standards, he said. But she was also warm and welcoming to younger singers. “It is hard to think of coming back to rehearsals without Megan,” Tipps said. “She is what great choirs are made of.”  The lives lost in El Paso Chad Hammerschmidt, professor and interim chair of the earth and environmental sciences department in which Betts studied, said the school is struggling to process her loss. “She was a wonderful person and student,” Hammerschmidt said. “This is a very difficult time for our community, university and academic department.”  Betts spent the last months of her life as a tour guide helping visitors explore the wilds of Montana, said Daniel Cottrell, her former supervisor at the Missoula Smokejumper Visitor Center. Cottrell said Betts was a “very positive person.” She earned a reputation for competence and was well-liked by her peers, Cottrell said. She also loved exploring new places, he said, especially Montana and its culture. ""She was full of life and really passionate,” Cottrell said. “She was a very caring individual.”  Cottrell said it is hard to believe that Megan Betts is gone. He also said he cannot believe “these things keep happening in this country,” referring to mass shootings. As DeAtley mourns, she is seeking comfort in a picture Betts drew of the two of them, along with several other friends. It was a Christmas present. “I cried when she gave it to me, and now it means so much more,” DeAtley said. Destefani, meanwhile, is holding on to a memory. She keeps thinking back to Girl Scout camp, when she and Betts found a novel way to survive a frigid day. “We just spent the whole day walking around with our arms around each other,” Destefani said. “We were warm and happy.”  "
17,"['Opinion | No, Mr. Trump. Guns are the reason for mass shootings.']","FOR A moment on Monday, President Trump offered a teasing hope that he would jolt the Republican Party into easing its roadblock on even the most obvious and popular gun-control measures. Following a grisly weekend of mass shootings, Mr. Trump tweeted in favor of “strong background checks” so that “something good, if not GREAT, comes out of these two tragic events!” Soon enough, the president subsided to form. He read a speech that focused on mental health issues, violent video games and the Internet as major factors in the nation’s increasingly bloody culture of gun violence. “Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger. Not the gun,” he said. But mental illness and hatred exist throughout the world, as do video games. Frequent mass shootings are unique to the United States. The reason is guns, and especially semiautomatics. Unique to the United States is easy access to the means to commit mass murder. Congress has improved mental health policies in recent years. Research shows little connection between violence found in video games and in the real world. And while the Internet can accelerate the spread of extremism, it does not create extremism. More might be done in all these areas. But the crucial variable is access to guns. The Post’s View: Trump can honor shooting victims by changing his hateful rhetoric Mr. Trump did restate his support for one gun-related measure, so-called red-flag laws that would allow judges to order the temporary confiscation of firearms from people who present imminent threats to themselves or others. If the president actually lobbied the GOP to follow through on this, it would be a good step. Though pro-gun groups decry such measures as avenues for weapon confiscation without due process, judges make the final call based on evidence of substantial threat. States that have enacted red-flag laws recently have seen notable progress on preventing suicide. At least one mass shooting appears to have been prevented because of a red-flag statute. But Mr. Trump has a history of talking a big game on basic gun control, only to fail to follow through. And even if he surprises in this case, a new red-flag law would not be nearly enough. The president’s apparent first instinct to tighten federal background checks was right. All firearms sales and transfers should be subject to checks — not just some, as is currently the case. The loophole that allowed the Charleston, S.C., church shooter to obtain weapons should be closed. And high-capacity magazines such as those used in this past weekend’s mass shootings, which allow shooters to mow down victims without breaking to reload, should be banned. Yet, as the House has passed bills to do such things, the Trump administration has signaled opposition, and the Republican Senate appears uninterested. No amount of talk about video games can distract from the fact that the nation’s gun laws are a major, deadly problem. No amount of sympathy for mass shooting victims will change the fact that the country’s cowardly Republican leaders are failing to address it.  "
18,['Opinion | A credit-rating agency warning should scare Montgomery County'],"BUOYED BY a spigot of federal contracting dollars, by wealthy residents and by a robust regional economy, virtually all the suburban localities around the nation’s capital, as well as the District itself, enjoy top credit ratings and, consequently, rock-bottom borrowing costs for building roads, bridges and other public works. But one major jurisdiction, Montgomery County, having tested the limits by playing fast and loose with its budget, has lately earned an unusual warning from Moody’s, one of the country’s three major bond rating agencies. That should put a scare into Montgomery taxpayers and their elected officials. The finger-wagging from Moody’s was triggered by what has become Montgomery’s habit of skimming funds it sets aside for the retiree health fund that pays medical expenses for former county employees and their dependents. Facing an array of constituencies with current demands, including police, firefighters and other government workers, county politicians have spread money around generously — and, in the process, shortchanged the retiree health trust fund. The result is that the fund, which has less than $1\xa0billion in assets and faces about $4.9 billion in future liabilities, is losing ground when it should be gaining, thereby putting at risk its ability to make future payments when they come due. (By contrast, the county’s pension fund for government employees is about 96 percent  funded.) That prompted Moody’s comment that the county’s pattern of siphoning off contributions is “credit negative.” Translation: Watch your step. A downgrade in Montgomery’s credit by Moody’s or the other rating agencies would mean sharply higher borrowing costs, forcing politicians to raise taxes, slash spending or both. Incredibly, county officials failed to mention the unusual warning from Moody’s to the County Council for more than a month. Even as the county’s elected officials diverted dollars from the retiree health fund, they approved generous new labor contracts that will mean sharply higher salaries and benefits for public employees, costing taxpayers an additional $40 million annually starting next year. This is precisely how Maryland’s largest and wealthiest locality finds itself skating on thin budgetary and fiscal ice. The responsibility is widely shared. Last year, the County Council unanimously approved then-County Executive Isiah Leggett’s proposal to skim $62\xa0million in contributions to the retiree health fund. This year, the council backed an even larger diversion, $90 million, pitched by Mr. Leggett’s successor, Marc Elrich (D), while making only slight trims to the fat union contracts Mr. Elrich negotiated. Just one member of the all-Democratic Council, first-termer Andrew Friedson (D-District 1), opposed skimming the contribution to the health fund to balance the budget. Next year’s $5.8 billion county budget earmarks $121 million for the fund, the required amount to restore it on a path toward solvency. Will Mr. Elrich and council members take a whack at that too? If so, the county’s slippery slope will get even slicker, and Montgomery will find itself in peril of becoming the region’s only major jurisdiction lacking a top-shelf credit rating — and saddled with higher borrowing costs.  "
19,['Opinion | A nuclear treaty is about to vanish. Its demise should teach a lesson.'],"ON FRIDAY, a pillar of global security will expire. Perhaps no one will notice when the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 slips into oblivion; the threat of nuclear attack in just minutes that seemed so unnerving during the late 20th century has now faded into a distant memory, lost to complacency at the Cold War’s end. But the demise of the INF Treaty should teach a lesson. Arms control, creating verifiable treaties to limit and reduce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, had its mystique: obtuse concepts, exotic hardware and mind-bending negotiations. But at its core, arms control was about political willpower. In the case of the INF Treaty, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev summoned enough of it to eliminate an entire class of deployed weapons, the ground-based missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles, and their launchers. The treaty made the world safer not only by removing a nuclear threat to Europe but also by introducing novel measures such as intrusive verification and on-site inspections. In recent years, the United States detected that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, was developing, testing and eventually deploying a ground-based cruise missile, the 9M729, prohibited by the treaty. The Obama administration protested the violation to Russia, repeatedly, to no avail; President Trump announced Oct. 20, 2018, that the United States would withdraw. The political will to stick with it was gone — Russia broke it, and Mr. Trump no longer had the desire to stick around. National security adviser John Bolton said Tuesday in a speech at the National Conservative Student Conference that the 2010 New START accord limiting strategic or long-range nuclear weapons was “flawed from the beginning” and “unlikely” to be renewed when it expires in 2021. “Why extend a flawed system just to say you have a treaty?” he asked. Mr. Bolton and Mr. Trump have held out the prospect of a negotiation that would include China’s nuclear weapons. This sounds reasonable, but China’s nuclear arsenal is only a fraction of what Russia and the United States maintain, and Beijing has ruled out negotiating. So is this administration serious or just creating a diversion? Likewise, Mr. Bolton said New START was flawed because it did not include short-range or tactical nuclear weapons, which have never been covered by treaty. Again, a reasonable goal, but the New START accord was meant to limit the long-range globe-spanning ballistic missiles, not the tactical weapons. Is the administration really serious about tackling this difficult new area of negotiations or just manufacturing a smokescreen? To rectify these “flaws” in arms control takes political will, not just facile one-liners. Without INF and New START, the world will have fewer restraints on nuclear weapons. Will that somehow be safer? Where is the political determination to carry on the hard work — the negotiating — to avert another nuclear arms race? So far, it is not evident. Time to make a difference, not just a point.  "
20,"['Opinion | Without the Amazon, the planet is doomed']","ONE OF the easiest ways to combat climate change is to stop tearing down old trees. This is why it is everyone’s problem that new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro seems determined to chop away at the Amazon rainforest, the world’s greatest reserve of old-growth forest. According to a recent analysis in the New York Times, “enforcement actions by Brazil’s main environmental agency fell by 20 percent during the first six months of the year, compared with the same period in 2018.” Fines, warnings and the elimination of illegal equipment from preservation zones are among the measures Brazil’s authorities are doing less often. “The drop means that vast stretches of the rain forest can be torn down with less resistance from the nation’s authorities.” The result has been a loss of 1,330 square miles of rainforest since January, a loss rate that is some 40 percent higher than a year previous, according to Brazilian government records. Mr. Bolsonaro has called his own government’s information “lies,” stripped the environment ministry of authorities and slashed the environmental budget. When eight former environment ministers protested in May, current environment minister Ricardo Salles alleged that there is a “permanent and well-orchestrated defamation campaign by nongovernmental organizations and supposed experts, within and outside of Brazil.” In its reality denial, Mr. Bolsonaro’s brand of right-wing populism closely resembles that of President Trump. Both leaders stoke unfounded suspicions that environmental concerns represent foreign plots to undermine the domestic economy. Both are committed to breakneck resource extraction while dismissing expert warnings. And both lead nations with special responsibilities in the global fight against climate change. Global warming cannot be successfully addressed without the engagement of the United States, the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases and erstwhile leader. The Brazilian Amazon, meanwhile, is a unique natural treasure, its abundance of plant life inhaling and storing loads of planet-warming carbon dioxide day and night. Without “the world’s lungs,” life on the planet is doomed. Earlier this month, the journal Science published a paper finding that, if world leaders made reforestation a priority, the planet’s ecosystems could accommodate massive numbers of new trees — perhaps hundreds of billions more. True, reforestation advocates would no doubt have to compete with those who would use land for other purposes, particularly as the world population increases. Even so, the paper’s authors note, their work “highlights global tree restoration as our most effective climate change solution to date.” This is not to say that the fight against global warming is as easy as planting a few, or even billions, of trees, if such a thing were politically or logistically feasible. As long as humans depend on carbon-emitting sources of fuel for energy, the atmosphere’s chemistry will continue to change and the climate will be in peril. But it does suggest that leaders such as Mr. Bolsonaro, who are leading in the opposite direction, can do particularly extreme damage to the effort to restrain climate change.  "
21,"['Boy Scouts failed to stop hundreds of previously unreported sexual predators, a lawsuit alleges']"," A group of lawyers is claiming to have uncovered hundreds of previously unreported cases of sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in Pennsylvania. The plaintiff in the case, named only as S.D. to keep his identity private, is alleging that he was assaulted “hundreds” of times by a scout leader in Pennsylvania over the course of about four years in the 1970s. The lawsuit alleges that S.D.\s abuse would not have been possible had it not been for the negligence of the Boy Scouts, that the organization conspired to keep incidents of sexual assault a secret, and that the organization and other defendants engaged in “reckless misconduct” in failing to protect its young participants. The complaint names the Boy Scouts, the Penn Mountains Council, and S.D.\s alleged abuser, and was filed in Philadelphia’s Court of Common Pleas. The litigation stems from an attempt to unearth previously unreported cases of child sexual abuse in one of the country’s most prominent youth organizations, spearheaded by Abused in Scouting, a group of law firms that collaborate on bringing such cases to light. For decades, the Boy Scouts organization has kept detailed files, known as the ineligible volunteer files, that documented thousands of pedophiles known to have preyed on children. In the past decade, a large tranche of the documents became public through lawsuits and investigative reporting. But those records may be incomplete. Included in S.D.\s lawsuit is a claim that Abused in Scouting has identified more than 350 people who do not appear in the ineligible volunteer files, S.D.\s alleged abuser among them. Victims of sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts were encouraged to come forward. Hundreds responded. “BSA knew for decades that sexual predators of boys had infiltrated scouting,” the complaint says, and claims that the organization “knew or should have known the dangers” that pedophiles within the organization, including S.D.\s alleged abuser, posed to children.                S.D.\s ordeal began in approximately 1974 or 1975, when he was 12 or 13, according to the lawsuit. He was the alleged victim of an assistant scoutmaster who “actively groomed young boys under his charge for later sexual molestation,” the lawsuit claims. S.D. was allegedly subjected to “hundreds of instances of fondling, hundreds of incidents of oral sexual assault and repeated attempts of anal penetration” at Camp Acahela, a Boy Scouts retreat in eastern Pennsylvania, as well as at his abuser’s home, the lawsuit says. Requests for comment sent to phone numbers and emails associated with the alleged abuser were not immediately returned. S.D. has “had tremendous affects from the abuse,” Stewart Eisenberg, S.D.\s representative and one of the lead lawyers from Abused in Scouting. “This is the first time he’s ever come forward. He’s held it in for all those years.” And S.D. is not alone. Over the past several months, Abused in Scouting has gathered hundreds of allegations from around the country from men — as old as 88 and as young as 14 — who claim they were assaulted or harassed during their time in the Scouts. The Washington Post reviewed a partially redacted spreadsheet, compiled by Abused in Scouting, containing details of more than 500 cases of abuse. Spurred by reports that the Boy Scouts organization was considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would narrow the window in which victims could be compensated, Abused in Scouting began gathering information from alleged victims in the spring. (In a statement, the Boy Scouts would not confirm any plans to file for bankruptcy but said it “is working with experts and exploring all options available.”) “We feel it’s an opportunity for those who were abused in scouting to come forward, to tell their story, to help themselves, and more importantly, to help others,” Eisenberg, said at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday. Abused in Scouting ran television ads throughout the United States asking people who had not previously reported to “protect tomorrow’s children, identify your abuser, and help put a stop to the cover up” in the Boy Scouts by contacting the lawyers. S.D., now 57, came forward after seeing one of those advertisements. “Once the phones started ringing, they have not stopped,” Andrew Van Arsdale, another leading attorney with the group, said on Tuesday. Victims of sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts were encouraged to come forward. Hundreds responded. Tim Kosnoff, a lawyer with Abused in Scouting, told The Post that they have forwarded the allegations they compile to the Boy Scouts, with the accusers’ names redacted, so that the organization can report the abusers to law enforcement as its policy requires. In a statement to The Post, the Boy Scouts said it had made about 120 reports to law enforcement based on information provided to them by Abused in Scouting. The Boy Scouts say that they have been communicating with Abused in Scouting as they file their reports, but Abused in Scouting’s lawyers said on Tuesday they had only received one such notice. “We care deeply about all victims of abuse and sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in Scouting,” the Boy Scouts said. “We believe victims, we support them, we pay for counseling by a provider of their choice, and we encourage them to come forward.” “The BSA has taken significant steps over many years to ensure that we respond aggressively and effectively to reports of sexual abuse,” the statement continued. “We recognize, however, that there were instances in our organization’s history when cases were not addressed or handled in a manner consistent with our commitment to protect Scouts, the values of our organization, and the procedures we have in place today.” The organization pointed to use of screening efforts and background checks to prevent abusers from joining its ranks. The group also provides “youth protection education” for members and bar one-on-one-interactions between adults and children. The Boy Scouts has a helpline where participants can report abuse. In January, it was revealed that an internal review of ineligible volunteer files from 1946 to 2016, led by Janet Warren of the University of Virginia, had so far identified 12,254 victims and 7,819 perpetrators in documents. The revelation came as Warren testified in a court case involving a children’s theater company, and caused a stir when another lawyer who handles abuse cases, Jeff Anderson, publicized her testimony at an April press conference. Boy Scouts lobby in states to stem the flow of child abuse lawsuits  “You can’t look at these files and do the math and come away with any other conclusion that this was a massive problem that was successfully kept hidden from the very people that needed to know this,"" Kosnoff said on Tuesday. Abused in Scouting lawyers hope that an increase in public concern about sexual assault, spurred by the #MeToo movement and investigations into other high-profile organizations such as the Catholic Church and USA Gymnastics, would encourage past Boy Scout victims to share their stories so “the next generation of kids did not have to suffer the way that they did,” Van Arsdale said. They also implored Congress to investigate. Most of the alleged assaults in the database of new cases viewed by The Post happened decades ago, though Abused in Scouting say it has a 17-year-old client.  It is not unusual for victims to come forward later in life, according to Camille Biros, a lawyer who has overseen compensation funds for victims of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Many victims she has worked with came forward in their 50s or 60s, and had not previously shared their stories. “There are many people who are ashamed, embarrassed, who don’t even want to attempt to report this,” she said. “I can’t tell you the number of grown men that just start weeping. They start telling the story and think they’ll be okay, but they just break down and sob.” For the men who decide to share their stories, money is rarely the primary motivation for finally coming forward, Biros explained. “They are looking for the acknowledgment that this actually happened to them,” she said. “Validation for the wrongs that are inflicted upon them."" The average age at which victims of childhood sexual assault choose to disclose the abuse is 52, according to the think tank Child USA. And more cases could be uncovered. This year, laws reforming the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse cases will go into effect in 18 states and the District of Columbia, according to Child USA, giving victims of childhood abuse a new opportunity to seek legal recourse. “We’ve never seen a year like this before,” said Marci Hamilton, Child USA’s founder and chief executive. “I don’t think the public is prepared for this tsunami of information about hidden child sex abuse in our culture.” "
22,['Opinion | Trump should do everything possible to warn China against a disastrous crackdown in Hong Kong'],"CHINA’S PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY this week released a propaganda video threatening military violence against protesters in Hong Kong. There are rumors of a growing military presence on the border between mainland China and its city-state, which, according to China’s past assurances, is meant to operate under a different (and freer) rule of law. In these circumstances, the United States should be doing everything possible to warn against a disastrous, Tiananmen-style  crackdown. Instead, President Trump on Thursday effectively flashed a green light, referring to the mostly peaceful protests as “riots” that China has to “deal with .\u2009.\u2009. themselves.” It’s not that Mr. Trump is unwilling to pressure China. This week, he was busy threatening new tariffs on imports from China and even criticizing that nation’s Communist dictator, Xi Jinping, for whom Mr. Trump is normally full of praise. But the pressure is purely mercantilist. Mr. Trump cares about how many U.S. soybeans China buys. He doesn’t care about China’s laying waste to human rights — its concentration camps in western China, its imprisonment and torture of human rights lawyers, its threats against Hong Kong’s freedoms. A wiser president would care about both trade and liberty. A crackdown in Hong Kong would have dire consequences, not only for the many American businesses located there and the tens of thousands of Americans living there but also for China’s reputation in Congress and beyond. If Beijing cannot keep its commitment to “one country, two systems,” under which Hong Kong is meant to operate with autonomy, why would anyone trust other promises it makes? A president interested in constructive U.S.-China relations would be making that point — while pushing back on the absurd Chinese accusations that the United States is fomenting the protests in Hong Kong. In fact, people in Hong Kong began their protests when their leaders, who are unfailingly responsive to Beijing’s wishes, promoted legislation that would have allowed for the easy extradition of people from Hong Kong to mainland China, including for political purposes. The massive popular outpouring prompted the leaders to suspend, but not withdraw, the bill. Now the protests have blossomed into calls for more democracy, which China over the years has foolishly blocked. In an unprecedented display of independence, thousands of civil servants defied orders to remain politically neutral by protesting Hong Kong’s government on Friday. Financial employees  and medical practitioners have also held rallies. More protests are scheduled for this weekend. But instead of looking for accommodation, the official response has included riot charges against a number of protesters that could lead to 10-year prison terms. With Beijing amping up its pressure on Hong Kong and the White House taking the wrong side, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers — Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and Reps.\xa0Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Christopher H.\xa0Smith (R-N.J.) — urged Mr. Trump to condemn China’s stance: “Failure to respond to Beijing’s threats to Hong Kong will only encourage Chinese leaders to act with impunity,” they wrote in an open letter. They are right.  "
23,['Opinion | Why go to the trouble of running for president to promote ideas that can’t work?'],"“I DON’T understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for,” Sen.\xa0Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Tuesday night, in the most notable zinger of July’s Democratic presidential primary debate. “I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the other major candidate on the field’s left wing, piled on. This got us thinking about some big ideas in U.S\xa0history. Like, say, amending the Constitution to outlaw liquor. Or sending half a million troops into Vietnam. Or passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy in a time of massive deficits. Ambition is essential, in other words, but not sufficient. The country faces big challenges, such as economic inequality and climate change, that call for creative solutions. They also call for wisdom, honesty and even a bit of modesty about government’s limitations. Having embraced President Barack Obama’s “no drama” approach to governing, often defined by the philosophy “don’t do stupid s---,” it would be odd if Democrats suddenly embraced ideological grandiosity as a prerequisite for service in the Oval Office. That means, first, that proposals should meet a baseline degree of factual plausibility — a bar that, for example, the Medicare-for-all plan that Mr.\xa0Sanders and Ms. Warren favor does not clear. Ms.\xa0Warren’s Tuesday night zinger was aimed at former congressman John Delaney (Md.), who had pointed out correctly that the numbers behind the proposal simply do not compute: The senators cannot deliver a system that provides far more benefits than other single-payer systems they claim as their model while preserving the level of care and access that insured Americans currently enjoy. They should make the case for a government monopoly on health care if they want, but they should be honest about the trade-offs. Candidates who promise big ideas should also be pressed on how they will realize them. Mr. Sanders says he will lead a revolution. Ms. Warren will take on the “giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat.” Then, the theory goes, they can bring about radical change. But the United States is a vast, pluralistic country, and Congress will continue to reflect its ideological range. Big donors and billionaires may exercise too much influence, but Democratic primary voters should be wary of candidates who use that fact to explain away all opposition to their ideas. Even if you undid Citizens United and enacted campaign finance reform, sustainable policy in America would emerge only by means of principled compromise.    Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) during the Democratic debate hosted by CNN on Tuesday in Detroit. (Paul Sancya/AP)  The next president should have a vision of progress for the nation that is expansive and inspiring. It also should be grounded in mathematical and political reality.  "
