It is unreasonable and more importantly unconstitutional to confiscate weapons out of hand. But, it is reasonable and constitutional to regulate them.Now is the time to institute national and uniform background checks prior to the purchase of firearms. We must change and close loopholes that cover gun-shows and person to person sales."
5,Alfredo Ortiz: In the Trump economy small businesses are thriving -- So why are Dems working to undermine it?,"White House trade adviser Peter Navarro addresses the intensifying trade tensions on 'America's Newsroom' after the Dow's worst trading day of the year.It&#x2019;s a sad fact but many national news outlets blatantly ignore how President Trump has done a great deal to revive and grow the economy and help small businesses prosper by increasing access to affordable, reliable energy.Under President Trump, the U.S. is experiencing record-low unemployment and rising wages the previous administration repeatedly said wasn&#x2019;t possible. As a result, small businesses are hiring at a record pace and President Trump&#x2019;s goal of energy dominance has played a big part in this economic expansion. Rather than restrict energy production, Trump policies are creating record production of oil and natural gas, which in turn are stabilizing energy prices and costs for companies.These stable or reduced fuel costs are especially beneficial to small businesses which are responsible for creating 62 percent&#xA0;of the jobs in the American economy. When small business owners pay less to power their operations or transport goods, they can grow, they can hire more people or pay higher wages to existing employees."

He was elected Republican Senate leader in November 2006 and is today the longest-serving Republican Senate leader in history.The story of McConnell&#x2019;s steady and relentless rise to power is best understood by reading his own memoir,&#xA0;&#x201C;The Long Game.&#x201D; He is candid and practical in exactly the down-home way he runs the Senate and his campaigns."
9,Andy Puzder: Blame China's broken promises for Trump imposing tariffs,"White House trade adviser Peter Navarro joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.'President Trump&#x2019;s strategic counter-tariffs on China have been deliberate, predictable and business-like &#x2013; contrary to Beijing&#x2019;s series of broken promises and the self-serving misinformation that China&#x2019;s state-run media are peddling.The president recently announced that the U.S. will follow through to implement a 10 percent tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports Sept. 1. The10 percent tariff had been put on hold earlier this year after a personal meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.The Chinese government is now attempting to portray President Trump&#x2019;s action as erratic and capricious, but nothing could be further from the truth."

11,"Kent Ingle: After El Paso &amp; Dayton, here are 5 ways to process grief in the face of tragedy","One of the victims was 15-year-old Javier Rodriguez; Jeff Paul reports.After the shootings this weekend in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, it feels like our nation is under continuous attack -- under the attack of racism, hatred, and our right to human life.There was a time when we were so rattled by just one of these tragic events, let alone two. These shootings have seemed a recurring nightmare in our nation. When these events have become so frequent that they are white noise on the news, it is terrifying. It makes me stop and ask, &#x201C;Is this really our nation? Is this reckless chaos really happening in America?&#x201D; It has caused us more pain than sometimes feels bearable. Whether or not you were affected by the deaths of these shootings, they cause us to consider the fragility of life and the suffering so many are currently facing.There is no easy way to explain the purpose of suffering on this earth, especially when the pain from the loss of life runs deeper than most any of us can bear. It wasn&#x2019;t what God initially intended for us. God is the creator and giver of all things good and beautiful, but our world is broken and, as of late, truly horrific."

16,Gil Barndollar: War with Iran would be foolish – Our relations will improve in the long run,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz may not be safe; Ellison Barber has the details.Despite increasingly bellicose rhetoric and a mounting tally of incidents, the United States and Iran have avoided war so far. Yet voices on both sides &#x2013; many of them at the highest levels of government &#x2013; are arguing that we should give war a chance.There are plenty of reasons why even a supposedly limited war with Iran is a bad idea. Chief among them are the nearly-guaranteed risks of escalation, the broader regional impact of a conflict, and the potential for chaos should the Iranian theocracy suddenly implode.But the strongest argument against U.S. escalation is oddly absent from the discussion: Why should the United States risk war &#x2013; with all of its unknowable consequences and chaos &#x2013; when the key trends in Iran are moving in America&#x2019;s favor?"
17,Samantha Nerove: Why so many mass murders?

It&#x2019;s nothing like the violent video games that allow players to happily &#x201C;kill&#x201D; animated figures from the safety of their bedrooms. As a combat veteran of two wars, I&#x2019;ve seen the terrible human cost of violence close up &#x2013; badly wounded fellow soldiers, others killed in the prime of life, enemy combatants burned beyond recognition.

23,"Daniel Turner, Kent Lassman: Green New Deal is no deal at all – We know because we studied it","Power the Future says the progressive policy will cost households at least $70,000 in the first year.When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,&#xA0;and Sen.&#xA0;Ed Markey, D-Mass.,&#xA0;unveiled the Green New Deal in February, they instantly changed the conversation on environmental policy. What in times past would be generally perceived as an intrusive, radically transformative proposal is now the center of Democratic Party&apos;s platform.Power the Future and the Competitive Enterprise Institute have released a joint study showing households in five states can expect tens of thousands of dollars in higher costs for energy, housing, transportation, and shipping if this proposal is implemented.Despite the astronomical costs, many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed the proposal, claiming the radical blueprint to ration energy and transform our economy is exactly what America needs. No longer is it &#x201C;climate change&#x201D; but &#x201C;climate emergency&#x201D; or even &#x201C;climate crisis.&#x201D; As such, small measures are unwelcome to Green New Deal supporters. Only the most radical environmental proposals, paired with a liberal wish list including single-payer health care, a jobs program, and decarbonization of the economy within a decade could possibly be enough."

25,Bradley Blakeman: Iran has been hostile to ships near the Strait of Hormuz – It's time for THIS solution,"The oil tankers, operated by British companies, were seized in international waters.The use of decoys has been used with great success to fool an enemy or deter an enemy from attacking what could be a trap or a trick.Who could forget the most famous decoy in war &#x2013; the Trojan Horse &#x2013; a giant hollow wooden horse used by the Greeks to fool the Trojans. The Horse was left at the gates of Troy as an offering of peace to the goddess Athena the goddess of war. After the horse was left at the gates of Troy, the Greeks retreated. Thereafter, the Trojans moved the horse inside the gates of Troy only to find that the horse was chock full of Greek &#x201C;special forces&#x201D; who exited the horse at dark, opened the gates of Troy and let in the Greek army who overwhelmed the Trojans and captured the city.Fast forward to 1942.

Meanwhile, the likes of Bernie Sanders admittedly refer to it as a &#x201C;third world country&#x201D; (though no one would label Sanders a racist for his brutal honesty). It is all just another display of civility dying within our nation.While government, culture and media would say civility should just be thrown out the window, or politeness is what you make it, scripture would say differently.
