# Summarize reasons of overfitting and underfitting 

- Overfitting:
    1. When a model gets trained with so much of data;
    2. when we have too many fetures.
- Underfitting:
    1. When we have less data to build an accurate model;
    2. when we try to build a linear model with a non-linear data;
    3. when we have too less features.
